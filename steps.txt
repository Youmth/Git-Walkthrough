/*
This file contains the steps to initialize a folder as a Git repository, add files, commit them, and push to a remote repository.

Steps:
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder:
    ```
    cd /c:/Users/dacv0/Documents/Codigo/Python/Git\ walkthrough/
    ```

2. Initialize the folder as a Git repository:
    ```
    git init
    ```

3. Add the files to the staging area:
    ```
    git add .
    ```

4. Commit the files with a message:
    ```
    git commit -m "ðŸ”¥ Initial commit"
    ```

5. Add the remote repository:
    ```
    git remote add origin https://github.com/Youmth/Git-Walkthrough.git
    ```

6. Push the changes to the remote repository:
    ```
    git push -u origin master
    ```

Note: The `-u` flag in the `git push` command sets the upstream (tracking) reference for the current branch, so that future `git push` commands can be run without specifying the remote and branch name.
