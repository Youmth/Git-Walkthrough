## Introduction
Git is a distributed version control system that helps you track changes in your code and collaborate with others. This tutorial will cover the fundamental concepts and commands you need to get started.

## Installation
To install Git, follow these steps:
1. Download the installer from the [official Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
3. Verify the installation by running `git --version` in your terminal.

## Basic Commands
Here are some basic Git commands to get you started:

- `git init`: Initialize a new Git repository.
- `git clone <repository-url>`: Clone an existing repository.
- `git status`: Check the status of your working directory.
- `git add <file>`: Stage changes for commit.
- `git commit -m "message"`: Commit staged changes with a message.
- `git push`: Push changes to a remote repository.
- `git pull`: Fetch and merge changes from a remote repository.

## Branching
Branches allow you to work on different features or fixes simultaneously. Common commands include:

- `git branch`: List all branches.
- `git branch <branch-name>`: Create a new branch.
- `git checkout <branch-name>`: Switch to a different branch.
- `git checkout -b <branch-name>`: Create and switch to a new branch.

## Merging
Merging combines changes from different branches. Use the following commands:

- `git merge <branch-name>`: Merge a branch into your current branch.
- `git rebase <branch-name>`: Reapply commits on top of another base tip.

## Collaboration
Collaborating with others involves using remote repositories. Key commands include:

- `git remote add <name> <url>`: Add a new remote repository.
- `git fetch`: Fetch changes from a remote repository.
- `git pull`: Fetch and merge changes from a remote repository.
- `git push`: Push changes to a remote repository.
